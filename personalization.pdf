JagTrack Module 1 - Personalization Choices
Student: Demetrius Maldonado
Date: 11/13/2025


CHOICE POINT #1: COLOR THEME
Option Chosen: [A]
Explanation: I choose to create my own color palette and based it on the primary colors of JA.
I chose black and gold, because we are the Jaguars might black and gold. 
 They work well together because they are like a jaguar's(the animal) color which in my opinion is a very good pattern.


CHOICE POINT #2: CLASS CONTENT
Option Chosen: [A]
Explanation:I chose to do the first option mostly because by the time I had gotten to this step I had already changed all the classes on the home page to match my current style. I only have 3 classes right now so I included a link to a dog video for my off block. 
Class List:
- Period 1: [html & css]
- Period 2: [Precalculus & Trigonometry]
- Period 3: [Economics]
- Period 4: [Off]


Calendar Customization
- I created a new calendar
- One
- Combined feed


Reflection:
[Write 4-5 sentences about the calendar integration:
- Calendar integration was tough
-I dont understand why my code is being so stingy
-I hope I can figure this out soon
-I figured it out
-The calendar looks cool]

- This calendar will help me know when assignments are due
- Google 404 errors are the vein of my existence
- I made assignments gold, GO jags!
- I like the weekly view
- I might add my own regular phone color
